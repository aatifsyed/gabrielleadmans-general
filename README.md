This is simple code to analyse data.

"flexstation data converter v3.py" was my first script, it crudely converts the awful format of data from the plate reader FlexStation into something I could use
"mydata.ipynb" is a notebook to convert the FlexStation data into nice graphs
"read_pickles" reads .pkl files from AlphaFold predictions and saves confidence measures as a csv (plddt, pTM and ipTM)
"PeptideMaker" splits a protein into peptides to be used in a BLAST alignment
